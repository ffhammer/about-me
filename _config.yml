  Hi, my name's Felix and I'm a Data Science student.
  Starting my Master's at ETH this September. Did quite a few student jobs so far, and gained solid experience.
  Did my Bachelor in Cognitive Science in OsnabrÃ¼ck, where I fell in love with AI and data science.
  My main drive is applying data science for ecology, like forest health monitoring.
  Most skilled in: <mark>Python</mark>, <mark>Data Science</mark>, <mark>Backend</mark>.

          To make the torturous task of finding a room in ZÃ¼rich easier, I built this tool.
          Fetches listings from wgzimmer.ch, woko.ch, and students.ch, adds geo API data like bike and public transport commute times to ETH.
          Tracks and shows all offers.
          Also generates WG applications based on your writing, with interactive improvements.

          Wanted a simple Anki-like tool to generate new cards from images of notes and chats, so I created this.
          Currently experimenting with personalized study plans and Duolingo-style exercises using agent systems.

          During my gap year, I tried to get better at git by building my own git clone in Go (gvc).
          Turns out, even after finishing, git still trips me up sometimes (:

          As a research assistant at Helmholtz UFZ, I worked with Prof. Liess on his ecotoxicology models, coding and evaluating how environmental stress amplifies pesticide effects.
          We're working on a new paper right now.

          For my deep learning course at NUS Lisbon, the prof organized an internal challenge to classify PokÃ©mon types from a custom dataset.
          I built my own dataset, trained a YOLO model for extraction, then fine-tuned deep CNNs and tried ArcFace.
          Ended up with the best performance in the class.

          Built a cooking assistant workflow for an NUS LLMs course.
          Helps users find dishes and navigate recipes, with custom Llama models for conversation, BERT for intent, Elasticsearch for search, and CLIP for image embeddings.

          For our Deep RL course, we tackled the universal pain of Sudoku.
           Used PPO and a custom environment; managed to solve easy Sudokus reliably.

          Together with two friends, we won both tracks of BBDC 2023 using extra weather/salinity data, advanced preprocessing, and models like LightGBM and XGBoost.
          Used autoencoders for weather features and lots of feature engineering.

          Probably the project I learned most from.
          At first, ConvNexts, Dynamic Margin ArcFace Loss, YOLO, etc. were intimidating.
          Kept coming back, learning more each time.

          My first real deep learning projectâ€”competed in the Kaggle challenge for whale/dolphin ID based on fins.
          We finetuned CNNs with triplet loss, spent most time on preprocessing.

          I fell in love with programming after my prof recommended Advent of Code in my first CS course.
          Did the first year in C++ in Jupyter (no autocomplete, no error messages). Switched to Python after.
          Don't always finish all 25 days, but still my December highlight every year!
